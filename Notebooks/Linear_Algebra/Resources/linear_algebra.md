# Linear algebra

Linear Algebra is the discipline that handles linear equations. You may have been introduced to some of these concepts before, but there's a lot to unpack here! Below are a ton of really helpful resources for solidifying your knowledge and understanding of linear algebra, and most specifically, vectors and matrices.

## Vectors and Matrices

### Matrix and Vectors - Fundamentals

[This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) series walks you through the basics of linear algebra inlcuding:
    1. [What are vectors?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1)
    2. [Linear Combinations, span, and basis vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=2) - This provides valuable insight into what vectors and matrices really represent behind the scenes, and why we would need to perform operations (addition, multiplication) on them!
    3. [Linear Transformations and Matrices ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3)
    4. [Matrix Multiplication as Composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=4)
    5. [Three Dimensional Linear Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHLEWRxRGiM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=5)

And several more valuable theoretical videos that extend into cross products, inverse matrices, and more for a valuable deep dive.

### Matrix and Vector Mulitplication
