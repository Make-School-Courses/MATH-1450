# Calculus - Derivatives

## Check Your Understanding!

Let's take some time to check in with ourselves and see how we feel about the main themes of today's lesson. Below are a few questions to check your understanding. Try to answer them on your own first, and then go back to the ones you might not feel so comfortable with. Find some resources, or ask your instructor or a friend and see if you can find the solution together!

1. Compute the derivative of the following function by hand:

<!-- Aligns with learning outcomes: 2 -->
2. Try to compute the partial derivative over y of the following:

<!-- Aligns with general concept of lesson -->
3. What is a *derivative*, and why are we learning about them? (Try to explain what, geometrically, this concept is finding or representing).

<!-- Aligns generally with learning outcomes: 3 -->
4. Write a Python function that calculates the gradient of x^2 at x = -3. (We should have gotten some good practice with this in class! Try at least pseudocoding it on your own before looking at your notes!)

<!-- Aligns with learning outcomes: 2, provides more exposure to a difficult concept -->
5. Using either the Symbolic package or Tensorflow, calculate the derivative over y of the following in Python:
